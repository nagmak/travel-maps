'''4 built in data structures in Python: list, tuple
dictionary and set'''

#LIST
#holds an ordered collection of items, eg: sequences, shopping list
#mutable data type: can add, remove or search for items in lists
#eg: creating an object i of class (type) int <- OOP in Python
#Class can have methods specified for it
#eg: list class has an append method to add items
#Class can also have fields/variables specific to it

#TUPLE
#holds together multiple objects
#similar to lists w/out extra functionality
#immutable to strings, cannot be modified
#Defined by items separated by commas and an optional parenthesis


#DICTIONARY
#address book to contain keys(name) + values(details)
#can only use immutable objects (eg: strings) for keys
#can use immutable or mutable objects for values
#use only simple objects for keys

#SEQUENCE
#Lists, tuples and strings are examples of sequences
#Major features: membership tests(in & not in expressions)
# and indexing operations (fetch an item in the sequence directly)

#SETS
#Unordered collections of simple objects

#REFERENCES
#variables pointing to part of comp memory where object is stored
#binding of the name to the object
